      <li>What is an array?</li>
      <p>An array is a data structure that stores multiple values in a single variable.</p>

      <li>What does it mean to "hardcode"?</li>
      <p>Hardcoding means to put fixed values directly into the code instead of using variables or inputs.</p>

      <li>Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.</li>
      <p>The constant text "Hei p√• deg, hvordan har du det?" gets put into an array, and split into seperate parts using split " " The array is then printed out per index, number and content.</p>

      <li>Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4</li>
      <p>Storing instances like this is good for organized storage, and makes it easier to add or remove instances without creating new variables</p>

      <li>Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
        example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
        wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
        "Thursday", how would it ideally look?</li>
      <p>The object Eweekdays stores the days of the week, and groups of days such as weekends and weekdays. All the days have different values and the groups have the value of the entire group together.
        Creating a group for workoutdays would look something like this WorkoutDays: { value: 0x01 + 0x04 + 0x08, name: "Workout Days" }  </p>

      <li>Explain how a "callback" routine works</li>
      <p>Callback routine is a sorting function that determines the order by comparing 2 values in an array then printing them out in accending order unless otherwise instructed. </p>

      <li>What happens in the sorting routines you have created?</li>
