      <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
      <p>Object oriented development is important because it helps structure and organize code. It allows code to be reused later in a program, and makes it easier for other people to work in a larger project at the same time.</p>

      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
        how this type of object can help us in software development.</li>
      <p>The object "AccountType" is used as a repository for a set account type storing values for different bank accounts. This object is helpful in programming since its reusable, easy to update/modify values and because its a simple format thats easy to understand. </p>

      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>
