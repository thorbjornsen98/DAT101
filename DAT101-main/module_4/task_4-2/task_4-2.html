      <li>Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.</li>

      <li>Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4</li>
      <p>[Write your answer here, and copy this for more answers]</p>

      <li>Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
        example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
        wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
        "Thursday", how would it ideally look?</li>
