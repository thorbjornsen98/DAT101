      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				You should use constants for values that do not change throughout a program. Variables should be used for values that can change or be reassigned as the program is running, this is ideal for user inputs or result outputs
        You can't only use constants, if a value is supposed to change during execution it must be a variable
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				parentheses change the order of operation (priority order) giving stuff inside priority over stuff outside. Its used the same way we use it in standard maths. 
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				To limit floating-point numbers to a given amount of decimals you can use toFixed(x), where x is the amount of decimals allowed.
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				[Replace this with you answer]
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				comparison operators return true or false (boolean values). You can use the result of a comparison directly to check if it is true or false.
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				Math.random() creates a "random" number between 0 and 1. It can be used to randomize values in games, selecting a random element in an array, or for anything that requires randomization
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				Modulus% returns the left over value after the operation is completed eg (13 % 5) would give output: 3
