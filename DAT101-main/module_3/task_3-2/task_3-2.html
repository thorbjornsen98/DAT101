      <li>In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?</li>

      <p>Yes, it is possible to do multiple things at the same time within a for loop </p>

      <li>In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?</li>

      <p>In order to make this an infinite loop while loop it would need to be structured in a way that the while loop never reaches a false state. Example for this particular task would be something like forgetting giving guess a value</p>

      <li>Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this.</li>

      <p></p>

      <li>Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops.</li>
